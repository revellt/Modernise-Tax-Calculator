# Modernise-Tax-Calculator
The Tax Calculator currently runs as a manually deployed static application and lacks a robust pipeline in place. This epic focuses on modernizing the application to deploy it on IBM Cloud1. But the web application will not just be simply lifted and shifted to cloud. The application will be containerized using Docker container2.
